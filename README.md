This repository provides an API that can be used to handle events on your community server(s) and manipulate them.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Your own community server within BattleBit Remastered with progression **disabled** and access to its launch options.
- The ability to write and compile [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) C# code.
- (for production) A place to host this API on.

### Writing

Documentation and examples can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/MrOkiDoki/BattleBit-Community-Server-API/wiki) (WIP).

The way to use this API is to make an instance of `ServerListener` (and start it) on which you pass the types of your *own* subclasses of `Player` & `GameServer`. In those subclasses, you can make your own overrides to the already existing methods in `Player` and `GameServer`. You can also add your own methods and fields/properties.

The easiest way to get started with all of this, is to use `Program.cs` and add your overrides etc. into `MyPlayer` & `MyGameServer`.

### Building

This project can either be built by using [`dotnet build`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build) on the command-line or by using the run / build options inside your preferred IDE.

### Connecting to the gameserver(s)

After writing and compiling this project. You will want to host it somewhere. This could be on the same server that the gameservers run on, or somewhere completely different. We do recommend to keep the latency to the gameserver minimal for smoother and faster communication. The same `ServerListener` can be used for *multiple* gameservers at the same time. You can specify the API server (address & port) in the launch options of the gameserver.

The gameserver connects to the API with the launch argument `"-apiendpoint=<IP>:<port>"`, where `port` is the port that the listener listens on and the `IP` is the IP of the API server.
